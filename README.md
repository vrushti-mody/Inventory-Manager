  Kiranawalas are small local shops that store grains and other food items and are present almost everwhere.
   The nearest kiranawala has emerged as the most preferred choice for the majority of consumers during the lockdown, a survey has shown.

"Seventy-two per cent consumers want to buy from locally sourced items going forward which goes on to show the trust built by Kiranas during lockdown," survey said.
